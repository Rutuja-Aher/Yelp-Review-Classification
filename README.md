## Introduction

Online reviews play a pivotal role in consumer decision-making. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically determine the sentiment and possibly other characteristics of Yelp reviews. This model can be valuable for businesses looking to gain insights from customer feedback and make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

- Data collection: Gathering Yelp review data from various sources or web scraping.
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering.
- Model selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for text classification.
- Training: Training the model on the labeled data.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using relevant metrics.
- Deployment: Deploying the model for real-time analysis or integration with other systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository due to its size. You can obtain the dataset from [provide the source or link]. The dataset contains a collection of Yelp reviews, each labeled with its sentiment or category.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

## Data Preprocessing

- Text cleaning: Removing noise, HTML tags, and special characters.
- Tokenization: Splitting text into words or tokens.
- Feature extraction: Converting text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

## Model Building

- Choose a machine learning algorithm for text classification (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models).
- Train the model on the preprocessed data.

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the model using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Visualize the results for better understanding.

## Deployment

The model can be deployed as a web service, integrated into a mobile app, or used in batch processing.

## Results

Include insights and visualizations derived from the model's predictions. Highlight the model's accuracy and its practical applications.
